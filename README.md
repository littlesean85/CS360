# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    The app I chose to design was one for being able to track weightloss goals.  So it was deisgned to allow them to log in and add create a goal for their desired weight and then they would be able to track their progress through updates they would put into the app.  This app was deisgned to help those looking to have a healthier lifestyle acheive the goals they set out for, and to allow them to track progress.  I wanted this because I find it easy to acheive my goals when I have something to follow as far as progress is concerned.


# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    In order to support hsi app, we needed a log in screen, as well as a goal screen and a progress screen for sure.  There is room for additions if you wanted to add more features in the future.  This designw as made to be easy to follow, similar to like a plug and play feature.  In these designs,  found them successful because it was a simple design and not overwhelming. 


# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    I approach coding by taking it in smaller steps, to not feel overwhelmed when putting everything together. I have found smaller steps and then piecing them together in the end.  I will use this in the future because I find I can get overwhelmed very easy sometimes, and I find that breaking things up into smaller pieces it takes the stress of the finished product off of my mind. 


# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    I use emulators and debuggers to ensure that everything is working the way I want it to and there isn't any issues with the code.  It also helps to have a second pair of eyes on the code as well, to see if there are any small details you might have overlooked.   This is an important step in the process because it can help get thigs out to launch and minimize any flws or bugs that might occur so that you can have a successful product without having to send out an update right away. 


# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    The challenge for me came in the finalization phase of everything which is where the programming came into play.  APp development was brand new to me with this course, so I had some trouble getting everything figured out and working the ay I wanted it to.  It took a lot of playing around , but Ithink I was able to accomplish what I set out to do with this.  The emulator allowed me to work out kinks in a live manner so to speak, so I could see what was happeneing when I would etst it out. 

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    I think my favorite part and the part I excelled with was the design phase.  I have always been full of ideas and like to design things, but never really knew how to implement them.  BUt now that I have learned skills from this class, I will be able to look into going further with it.  BUt with this imparticular the design phase and putting it together was the best section for me.
